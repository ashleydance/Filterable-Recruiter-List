# :poop: A Filterable list of Recruiters

This was built to try and combat an issue of recruitment company spam the company I currently work at faces. As a company policy we do not work with recruitment agencies, so when they phone up asking to speak to someone but asking their company name we can check to see if they appear in this list. This [list](https://github.com/alexmbird/uk-it-recruiter-domains) is generated from a text file from Alex Hewson.

This project was built with React as a small project for me to begin my journey of learning some of the Frontend JavaScript libraries.
